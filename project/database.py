# update_candidate_status, update_candidate_status_and_hex_id) are removed.

# If there's a need for a generic database initialization hook for Flask,
# it can be redefined here for PostgreSQL if required, but currently,
# app.py's init_db (called by data_initializer) handles PostgreSQL schema.
# The init-db CLI command associated with SQLite is also removed.
# If a PG equivalent is needed, it can be added to app.py or a new CLI module.
