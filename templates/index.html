            <h2>Welcome to PrayReps!</h2>
            <p>Thank you for joining with us in prayer for all those who serve in government.</p>
            <p>You'll see one representative at a time. Take a moment to pray for them, then click "üôè Amen" to move to the next person.</p>
            <p>If it helps, here are some good pointers for how to pray:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Celebrate God‚Äôs love for them, his knowledge of them, and his desire for relationship with them</li>
                <li>Thank God for them and recognise all the ways their lives have reflected being made in God‚Äôs image in the past, and all the ways they will do so in the future</li>
                <li>Ask God that someone would tell them about God‚Äôs great love for them</li>
                <li>Pray that as they learn about God and come to know Him that they would love him and in return desire deeper relationship and fellowship</li>
                <li>Expect the Kingdom of God to be present in their lives and that as God establishes His Kingdom in their lives, they would be so excited to be transformed into His likeness</li>
                <li>And as God builds his Kingdom in them that it would transform everything in their lives: their families, their friends, their communities, their Parliamentary colleagues, and the way they serve their constituencies.</li>
                <li>And remember the church in the places these people serve, pray for their encouragement and to be a strong foil for the work of the politicians. That the Body of Christ would welcome and invite and love their MP while advocating, championing and challenging on behalf of that place.</li>
                <li>And that as MPs and churches seek God‚Äôs heart for these places that the Kingdom would come and lives would be transformed, renewed, revived, restored, and all the other things found where God is at work.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you click Amen the map will update to show who you've prayed for.</p>
