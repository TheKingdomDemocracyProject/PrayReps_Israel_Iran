    <h2>Welcome to PrayReps!</h2>
    <p>
        PrayReps is a tool designed to help individuals and groups systematically pray for elected
        representatives. This version focuses on the representatives serving the countries of
        <strong>Israel</strong> and <strong>Iran</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our vision is to foster consistent and informed prayer for those in leadership,
        believing that prayer can make a difference in their lives, their work, and the
        nations they serve.
    </p>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>View Representative:</strong> On the <a href="{{ url_for('main.home') }}">Home page</a>,
            you'll be presented with one representative at a time. You'll see their name,
            photo (if available), political party, and the country they serve.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The Map:</strong> A hexagonal map of the representative's country is displayed.
            <ul>
                <li>The area the current representative is associated with will be highlighted (usually in yellow).</li>
                <li>Locations for representatives you've already prayed for will be marked with a heart icon (‚ù§Ô∏è).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pray:</strong> Take a moment to pray for the displayed representative.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mark as Prayed:</strong> Once you've prayed, click the "üôè Amen" button.
            This records your prayer, marks their location on the map with a heart, and then
            presents the next representative from the queue.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Navigating the Site</h3>

    <h3>The Vision</h3>
    <p>
        This application is inspired by the vision of the <a href="https://kingdomdemocracy.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kingdom Democracy Project</a>,
        which seeks to encourage Christians to engage positively with democratic processes, including
        praying for those in authority. While this is a simple tool, we hope it serves as a helpful resource.
    </p>
