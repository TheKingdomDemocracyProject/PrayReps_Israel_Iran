    <h2>Welcome to PrayReps</h2>
    <p>
        PrayReps is a tool designed to help individuals and groups systematically pray for those
        who serve their countries as part of government. This version focuses on <strong>Israel</strong> 
        and <strong>Iran</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>"...for the authorities are God‚Äôs servants, who give their full time to governing."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        Our vision is to foster a love for those who serve the world by giving their full time to governing
        through making it easier to engage in consistent and informed prayer for those in leadership, 
        seeking the increase of God's Kingdom in their lives, their work, and the nations they serve.
    </p>

    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>View representative:</strong> On the <a href="{{ url_for('main.home') }}">home page</a>,
            you'll be presented with one representative at a time. You'll see their name, photo (if 
            available), political party, and the country they serve.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The map:</strong> A hexagonal map of the representative's country is displayed.
            <ul>
                <li>An area on the map will be highlighted in yellow.</li>
                <li>In some countries that area will be an approximation of where that person is elected 
                    to serve</li>
                <li>Locations for representatives you've already prayed for will be marked with a heart 
                    icon (‚ù§Ô∏è).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pray:</strong> Take a moment to pray for the displayed representative.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mark as prayed:</strong> Once you've prayed, click the "üôè Amen" button.
            This records your prayer, marks the location on the map with a heart, and then
            presents the next representative from the queue.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The Vision</h3>
    <p>
        This tool is part of 
        <a href="https://kingdomdemocracy.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Kingdom 
            Democracy Project</a>, which seeks to enable the Church to love and serve the places we vote 
        in and the people we vote for. While this is a simple tool, we hope it serves as a helpful resource.
